# Watermelon - Python Plotly Graphing for Dates and Temps

Simple python script for plotting some temps and dates to a graph for a nice visualization.

## Basic usage

Requirements:
`plotly` `pandas`
To install run the requirements.txt like this `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or run `pip install plotly==4.4.1` | `pip install pandas`

You'll need two external files:

1. ambientTemps.txt
2. internalTemps.txt

These will have your temps and dates in a fashion like this:

```text
|TEMP|DATE
|TEMP|DATE
|TEMP|DATE
|TEMP|DATE
```

After that initial setup execute and your graph will be available in your browser!
